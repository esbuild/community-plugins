## How to use a plugin

To use an esbuild plugin, you generally import it into your build script and then pass it to the esbuild API like this:

```js
const esbuild = require('esbuild')
const somePlugin = require('some-plugin')

esbuild.build({
  plugins: [
    somePlugin(),
  ],
  ...
}).catch(() => process.exit(1))
```

More documentation about plugins and the plugin API is available [here](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/#using-plugins).

## Adding your plugin here

If you would like to add your plugin to this list, create a PR that updates this README file. The update should add a single bullet under the **Plugin list** section that starts with a link to the plugin and is followed by a brief one-sentence description. The text of the link should be the npm package name and it should be inserted in alphabetical order. It should look something like this:

* [example-esbuild-plugin](https://github.com/esbuild/example-esbuild-plugin): A plugin to load `*.example` files.

Before creating a PR, please make sure that:

* The package is already published to npm
* You are the author of the plugin
* You are willing to respond to issues about the plugin if people file issues against it
